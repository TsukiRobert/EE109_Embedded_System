		    Lab 6 - Rotary Encoders and Interrupts

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (2 points) TIMER1 is to be used to output a 50% duty cycle signal
(squarewave) for tone generation as was done in this lab.  For the two tones
specified below, determine a prescalar, the OCR1A value, and the number of
interrupts to allow before stopping the timer.  Your answer for the prescalar
and OCR1A values should be the ones that give the most accurate timing.

a. 200 Hz tone for 5 seconds
OCR1A = 16000000/(2*64*200)-1 = 624
The pre scalar would be 64
Number of interrupts would be 5s * 2 * 200Hz = 2000


b. 32 Hz tone for 2 seconds

OCR1A = 16000000/(2*128*32) -1 = 121
Prescalar 128
Number of interrupts would be 32Hz * 2 * 2s = 128


2. (1 point) Briefly explain why updating the LCD display in your ISR could
lead to undesirable behavior for this lab.
Because ISR function has high priority which would change right after there is a pin change detected. If you update the pin in the function, it would have a very long delay which affects the whole process.
