Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Review the conceptual operation of a timer interrupt.

  a. For a 16-bit timer with clock frequency of 16MHz (like the Arduino) and
  prescalar of 64, how much time corresponds to a timer value of 2000?

First, we divide 16000000Hz by 64 which we get 250000. The 250000 corresponds to 1 second.
Then we divide 2000 by 25000 = 0.008s which is 8ms.




  b. With a clock frequency of 16MHz and prescalar of 8, what is the longest
  amount of time we can track with an 8-bit hardware timer.
Each clock cycle for a 16000000Hz clock is 1/16000000 = 62.5ns. For a prescalar of 8, each timer
Tick last for 62.5*8 = 500 ns. Since 2^8=256, 8 bit counts from 0 to 255. So 500ns * 256 = 128 microseconds



2. (2 points) The Timer modules we have used also have the ability to make an
output pin turn ON (set), OFF (clear), or Toggle when the timer reaches the
OCR1A or OCR1B values (i.e. the hardware can automatically control the output
value of a pin). By searching the data sheet (ATmega328P datasheet is linked on
our website from the Tools and Links page) answer the following question:

   a.  TIMER1 (the 16-bit timer) can control the pins that are associated with
   OC1A and OC1B signals. Find to what pins these signals are wired by looking
   at Figure 1.1 ("28 PDIP" package diagram) on page 12 of the data sheet, or
   alternatively, Tables 14-3, 14-6, or 14-9.
   For OCA1A, it's linked to PB1 (15). For OCA1B, it's linked to PB2 (16).


   b.  In this lab we use TIMER1 in the "Clear Timer on Compare" or CTC
   mode. In this mode when the counter reaches the value in OCR1A register it
   generates an interrupt and starts counting again from zero. Using the
   information in section 16.11.1 and table 16-1, describe what the OC1A and
   OC1B pins would do when the timer reaches the OCR1A value if during
   initialization we used the statement TCCR1A = 0x60;

   When TCCR1A = 0x60, it means pin 5 and 6 are turned on. Pin 5 and Pin 6 turned on indicates that COM1B1 and COM1A0 is set to 1 while the rest two remains zero. In the non-PWM mode, if COM1B1 is high and COM1B0, it would clear OC1B on compare match and set output to low level. IF COM1A0 is high and COM1A1 is low, it would just toggle it on compare match.
