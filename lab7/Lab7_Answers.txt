Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (3 points) Review the conceptual operation of an ADC and use the given
parameters to find the desired value.

  a. Your 8-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 1V and 4V, what digital
  number would result from sampling a 2.0V?
  2^8-1= 255
  (2-1)/(4-1)*255 = 85


  b. Your 5-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 0V and 5V, what input
  voltage would yield a digital number of 12?
  2^5-1 = 31
  0V + (12/31)*(5v-0v) = 1.94V


  c.  Your 6-bit ADC has a Lo reference voltages of 2V. A voltage is sampled at
  2.4V and the digital result is 26. What was the Hi reference voltage used by
  the ADC?

  2^6-1=63
  2V + (2.4-2)*63/26 = 2.97V


1. (2 point) Tammy Trojan has determined that the servo motor can be controlled
by TIMER2 even though the PWM period is 16.4ms rather than the preferred 20ms.
Billy Bruin also wants to control a similar servo motor but feels it must use a
PWM signal with a 20ms period so he will have to use the 16-bit TIMER1 to
produce the signal.  Note: When TIMER1 is used for PWM, the OCR1A register
determines the pulse period, and OCR1B register determines the pulse width.
What values will Billy have to use for the TIMER1 prescalar, the OCR1A value to
give a 20ms pulse period, and the values for OCR1B to give the minimum pulse
width of 0.75ms and the maxumum pulse width of 2.25ms?

OCR1A = Tx16MHz/prescalar-1
      = 0.02*16000000/64 - 1
      = 4999
OCR1B = PulseWidth*(OCR1A+1)/T + 1
Minimum width: OCR1B = 0.00075*(5000)/0.02 - 1 = 187
Maximum width: OCR1B = 0.00225*5000/0.02 - 1 = 561
So with a prescalar = 64, OCR1B value are 187 and 561
